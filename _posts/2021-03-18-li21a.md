title: " Online Forgetting Process for Linear Regression Models "
abstract: ' Motivated by the EU’s "Right To Be Forgotten" regulation, we initiate
  a study of statistical data deletion problems where users’ data are accessible only
  for a limited period of time. This setting is formulated as an online supervised
  learning task with \textit{constant memory limit}. We propose a deletion-aware algorithm
  \texttt{FIFD-OLS} for the low dimensional case, and witness a catastrophic rank
  swinging phenomenon due to the data deletion operation, which leads to statistical
  inefficiency. As a remedy, we propose the \texttt{FIFD-Adaptive Ridge} algorithm
  with a novel online regularization scheme, that effectively offsets the uncertainty
  from deletion. In theory, we provide the cumulative regret upper bound for both
  online forgetting algorithms. In the experiment, we showed \texttt{FIFD-Adaptive
  Ridge} outperforms the ridge regression algorithm with fixed regularization level,
  and hopefully sheds some light on more complex statistical models. '
