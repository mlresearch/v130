title: " A Dynamical View on Optimization Algorithms of Overparameterized Neural Networks "
abstract: " When equipped with efficient optimization algorithms, the over-parameterized
  neural networks have demonstrated high level of performance even though the loss
  function is non-convex and non-smooth. While many works have been focusing on understanding
  the loss dynamics by training neural networks with the gradient descent (GD), in
  this work, we consider a broad class of optimization algorithms that are commonly
  used in practice. For example, we show from a dynamical system perspective that
  the Heavy Ball (HB) method can converge to global minimum on mean squared error
  (MSE) at a linear rate (similar to GD); however, the Nesterov accelerated gradient
  descent (NAG) may only converge to global minimum sublinearly. Our results rely
  on the connection between neural tangent kernel (NTK) and finitely-wide over-parameterized
  neural networks with ReLU activation, which leads to analyzing the limiting ordinary
  differential equations (ODE) for optimization algorithms. We show that, optimizing
  the non-convex loss over the weights corresponds to optimizing some strongly convex
  loss over the prediction error. As a consequence, we can leverage the classical
  convex optimization theory to understand the convergence behavior of neural networks.
  We believe our approach can also be extended to other optimization algorithms and
  network architectures. "
