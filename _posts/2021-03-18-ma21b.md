title: " Reaping the Benefits of Bundling under High Production Costs "
abstract: " It is well-known that selling different goods in a single bundle can significantly
  increase revenue. However, bundling is no longer profitable if the goods have high
  production costs. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new mechanism, Pure
  Bundling with Disposal for Cost (PBDC), where after buying the bundle, the customer
  is allowed to return any subset of goods for their costs. We provide two types of
  guarantees on the profit of PBDC mechanisms relative to the optimum in the presence
  of production costs, under the assumption that customers have valuations which are
  additive over the items and drawn independently. We first provide a distribution-dependent
  guarantee which shows that PBDC earns at least 1-6c^{2/3} of the optimal profit,
  where c denotes the coefficient of variation of the welfare random variable. c approaches
  0 if there are a large number of items whose individual valuations have bounded
  coefficients of variation, and our constants improve upon those from the classical
  result of Bakos and Brynjolfsson (1999) without costs. We then provide a distribution-free
  guarantee which shows that either PBDC or individual sales earns at least 1/5.2
  times the optimal profit, generalizing and improving the constant of 1/6 from the
  celebrated result of Babaioff et al. (2014). Conversely, we also provide the best-known
  upper bound on the performance of any partitioning mechanism (which captures both
  individual sales and pure bundling), of 1/1.19 times the optimal profit, improving
  on the previously-known upper bound of 1/1.08. Finally, we conduct simulations under
  the same playing field as the extensive numerical study of Chu et al. (2011), which
  confirm that PBDC outperforms other simple pricing schemes overall. "
