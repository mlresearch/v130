title: " Improved Exploration in Factored Average-Reward MDPs "
abstract: " We consider a regret minimization task under the average-reward criterion
  in an unknown Factored Markov Decision Process (FMDP). More specifically, we consider
  an FMDP where the state-action space $\\mathcal X$ and the state-space $\\mathcal
  S$ admit the respective factored forms of $\\mathcal X = \\otimes_{i=1}^n \\mathcal
  X_i$ and $\\mathcal S=\\otimes_{i=1}^m \\mathcal S_i$, and the transition and reward
  functions are factored over $\\mathcal X$ and $\\mathcal S$. Assuming a known a
  factorization structure, we introduce a novel regret minimization strategy inspired
  by the popular UCRL strategy, called DBN-UCRL, which relies on Bernstein-type confidence
  sets defined for individual elements of the transition function. We show that for
  a generic factorization structure, DBN-UCRL achieves a regret bound, whose leading
  term strictly improves over existing regret bounds in terms of the dependencies
  on the size of $\\cS_i$’s and the diameter. We further show that when the factorization
  structure corresponds to the Cartesian product of some base MDPs, the regret of
  DBN-UCRL is upper bounded by the sum of regret of the base MDPs. We demonstrate,
  through numerical experiments on standard environments, that DBN-UCRL enjoys a substantially
  improved regret empirically over existing algorithms that have frequentist regret
  guarantees. "
