title: " Follow Your Star:  New Frameworks for Online Stochastic Matching with Known
  and Unknown Patience "
abstract: " We study several generalizations of the Online Bipartite Matching problem.
  We consider settings with stochastic rewards, patience constraints, and weights
  (considering both vertex- and edge-weighted variants). We introduce a stochastic
  variant of the patience-constrained problem, where the patience is chosen randomly
  according to some known distribution and is not known in advance. We also consider
  stochastic arrival settings (i.e. the nature in which the online vertices arrive
  is determined by a known random process), which are natural settings that are able
  to beat the hard worst-case bounds of adversarial arrivals. We design black-box
  algorithms for star graphs under various models of patience, which solve the problem
  optimally for deterministic or geometrically-distributed patience, and yield a 1/2-approximation
  for any patience distribution. These star graph algorithms are then used as black
  boxes to solve the online matching problems under different arrival settings. We
  show improved (or first-known) competitive ratios for these problems. We also present
  negative results that include formalizing the concept of a stochasticity gap for
  LP upper bounds on these problems, showing some new stochasticity gaps for popular
  LPs, and bounding the worst-case performance of some greedy approaches. "
